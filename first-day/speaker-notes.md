# Hi, Iâ€™m Mrs. Levy

My name is Sophia Levy. I was born in Indonesia. I moved to Vancouver, Canada when I was 17 to finish high school.

I received my Bachelor of Music degree from Berklee College of Music in Boston, where I majored in Music Synthesis.

The program covered the whole spectrum of music technology, including songwriting, recording, producing, and performing.

One of my favorite memories from Berklee was winning a songwriting contest and performing it at the Berklee Performance Center.

Fun fact: my bass player for that show went on to join John Mayerâ€™s band!

# Coming to Colgan
- A couple years ago, I was invited by Mr. Mills to host a masterclass on songwriting and project feedback, and I was so impressed with the talent of the students here and the work they were doing.

- So when the opportunity came up to be the new Music Tech teacher at CFPA, and continue the amazing work that Mr. Mills started, I knew this was where I needed to be.

# So, what are we going to do in this class? 

- If you look at the name, Music Technology, we are basically going to do the Music and the Technology! What does that mean?

- We will be learning Music Writing and Music Performance. And, the technology to support both areas. 

- We'll use the Digital Audio Workstation to support the music writing part. And the Live Audio Engineering will support the Music Performance part. Technology allows our music to reach more people and gives a great live music experience. You are going to be learning all of those subjects in this class.
